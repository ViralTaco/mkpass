## FAQ
### Is it safe?
'Iunno. It might be safer than reusing the same password.
### Is it random?
The universe is deterministic. Randomness doesn't exit.  
This is as close as I'll get (unless I want to get there slower).
### Is it cryptographically safe?
It's open-source. You don't have to compile it as-is.
### Is it a pony?
It's open-source.
### Why write a password generator?
ADHD. I wanted to sign up on a popular "hub" website, and little blood was reaching my brain at that time.  
I was just surprised by how fast I came up with it and decided to keep it.
### Is it malware?
It's open-source.
